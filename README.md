# SKURK 🎮

**Silver since day one. Tactical chaos, technical issues, and accidental knife kills – we are SKURK.**

This is a semi-joke website made for friends, **SKURK**.  
A fun project built among friends, just for laughs. Nothing serious, just pure noob energy, ridiculous match stats, and a whole lot of personality.
